**RugDox LLC User Agreement**

**Purpose & Commitment**

RugDox LLC's RugID system is designed to promote trust and protect communities by ensuring individuals act with integrity. The purpose of this system is to provide community members with confidence that those they interact with are accountable. By securely vaulting your data, RugDox LLC aims to deter malicious behavior while preserving your privacy and security. We prioritize your security and use advanced data protection methods to safeguard your information.

Your data will only be used if there is confirmed evidence linking your identity to activities that violate this Agreement. Our goal is not to punish, but to maintain a fair and trustworthy community.

---

**Integrity Commitment**

This Agreement is fundamentally based on integrity. While RugDox LLC's primary objective is to prevent fraud and crime specifically within Web3 industries (including crypto, NFTs, and digital asset-related ventures), the principles of trust and accountability apply more broadly. 

If a User is found to have engaged in fraudulent behavior outside the Web3 space — whether in traditional industries, financial schemes, or other misconduct — such actions inherently compromise the trust that this Agreement is designed to build. While such non-Web3-related fraudulent behavior may not automatically invalidate this Agreement, it reflects a clear violation of the trust expected of a Web3 community leader, project founder, or administrator. RugDox LLC reserves the right to take such violations into account when assessing the User's standing in the RugID system and the community.

---

**User Responsibilities and Liabilities**

2.1 **Truthful Information:** Users must provide truthful, accurate, and complete information. This includes, but is not limited to, verified address details, picture identification, and additional documentation as requested by RugDox LLC. Providing false information may result in penalties outlined herein.

2.2 **Commitment to Integrity:** Users agree to act in good faith and refrain from activities that could be perceived as fraudulent or harmful to their community. This includes actions that could result in financial loss or reputation damage to others.

2.3 **Fraud Prevention & Accountability:** RugDox LLC will only act to confirm and verify data when potential fraudulent activity is identified. Fraudulent activities include, but are not limited to, actions involving deception, misrepresentation, or misconduct by Web3 project owners, founders, or admins in crypto, NFTs, or other digital asset-related ventures. If the User is linked to verifiable fraudulent actions, the Company may collect and report relevant data to appropriate authorities or, in certain cases, publicly disclose data through the unMASK Protocol to warn affected parties. 

**Note:** This is not intended to assume guilt but to provide verifiable data that authorities may use in their investigations. For detailed information about the unMASK Protocol process, please reference our website once available.

2.4 **Indemnification:** Users agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless RugDox LLC from claims, liabilities, damages, or costs resulting from their breach of this Agreement or verified fraudulent activity.

---

**Data Collection and Security**

3.1 **Data Security Measures:** RugDox LLC protects your personal data using:

- A two-layer Hybrid Encryption followed by advanced post-quantum encryption.
- Offensive protection methods designed to ensure the vault's data integrity at all times.
- Industry-standard security protocols designed to minimize the risk of data breaches.

3.2 **User Assurance:** While RugDox LLC takes significant measures to protect your data, no security system is infallible. By agreeing to this Agreement, the User acknowledges these risks.

---

**Cancellation, Investigations & Data Use**

13.1 **No Right to Cancellation During Investigation:** To ensure the integrity of the unMASK Protocol, the User agrees they may not cancel or alter their RugID registration during an ongoing investigation if linked to suspected fraudulent activities. This measure is critical to protecting communities and ensuring due diligence in fraud prevention.

13.2 **Limited Right to Withdraw Consent:** The User understands that consent for data collection, processing, and storage may not be withdrawn once an investigation is activated or if such withdrawal would interfere with ongoing legal processes.

13.3 **Corrective Action in Case of Error:** Users have the right to submit evidence proving they were incorrectly linked to fraudulent activities. In such cases, RugDox LLC will promptly review the evidence, correct the record, and restore the User's standing in the community.

---

**User Bill of Rights**

To build user trust, RugDox LLC outlines the following rights for all users:

- **Transparency:** Users will be informed when their data is being reviewed or disclosed in accordance with the unMASK Protocol.
- **Correction of Errors:** Users have the right to present verified documentation to correct inaccuracies in the RugID system.
- **Security Updates:** RugDox LLC will provide regular security updates and notify users of changes to its data protection methods.
- **Clear Appeal Process:** If a User disagrees with an outcome linked to suspected fraudulent activity, they have the right to appeal the decision through a dedicated review process. Please note that in rare circumstances, law enforcement authorities may require RugDox LLC to provide all investigative information, including securely vaulted data, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Such requests are beyond our control and may limit or prevent our ability to proceed with the appeal process as outlined in this Agreement.
---

**Summary of Commitments**

By signing this Agreement, the User acknowledges that RugDox LLC is dedicated to building a safe, fraud-resistant environment that values fairness, accountability, and the protection of personal data. The User agrees to cooperate with the Company in maintaining these principles.
